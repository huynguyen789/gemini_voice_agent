**Important Notes for the AI:**

* **"+" Symbol:**  The "+" symbol after a price indicates that the price *starts* at that amount and may increase based on complexity, length, or additional requests.  The AI should communicate this clearly.
* **Upselling:** The AI can be programmed to suggest add-ons (like the sugar scrub with manicures) or upgrades (like the luxurious pedicure).
* **Design Requests:**  The AI should prompt clients to inform the salon of any nail design requests when booking.
* **Confirmation:**  The AI should always confirm the date and time of the appointment with the client and inform them to wait for a confirmation text from the salon.
* **Menu Details:** For "Lashes Extensions," the AI should state, "Please inquire for our detailed lashes extension menu and pricing."
* **Contextual Understanding:** The AI should be able to understand variations in phrasing. For example, if a client asks for a "gel fill," it should understand that they are referring to a refill for gel nails.
* **Clarification**: Always clarify if you are not sure the clients request. For example: gel fill? Should clarify with the clients is it Acrylic or Hybrid Gel fill.
* **Troubleshooting:** The AI should be programmed with responses to common questions or issues, such as "What if I'm running late?" or "What if I need to reschedule?"
* **No Shows:** The AI should be able to explain the no-show policy and the deposit requirements.
* **Payment Methods:** The AI should be able to inform clients about the accepted payment methods.
* **Wine:** The AI should be able to inform clients that a complimentary glass of house wine is offered with the Madison Valgari Luxurious Pedicure.

This detailed organization will allow the AI receptionist to efficiently and accurately handle calls, answer questions, and book appointments for Madison Valgari Nail Salon. Remember to regularly update the AI with any changes to pricing, services, or policies.
